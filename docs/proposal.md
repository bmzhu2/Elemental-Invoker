# Elemental Invoker

## Overview

Elemental Invoker is a puzzle/board game where you arrange pieces on a board into formations, and cast spells for points based on those formations. The four different types of pieces that can appear on the board have distinct movement properties, and spells all require unique formations and combinations of elements on the board. The gameplay is inspired by the [Shipwrightery minigame from Puzzle Pirates](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Shipwrightery), and the theme of elements and spells are mostly borrowed by the [Golden Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun) video game series.

## Functionality

* A 5x5 board with pieces that have unique movement properties that are able to be moved by clicking and dragging
* A list of spells with formations of elements that can be dragged and dropped onto the board
* New spell and new pieces are generated after each spell cast
* Points are scored on spell cast, combos are generated by consecutive spell casts and broken by moving pieces in between
* Game ends after 10 spells are cast, then going through a 15 second bonus round where pieces cannot be moved but more spells may be cast
* Background music and sound effects on spell cast, toggled on optionally at the user's discretion
